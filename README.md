FrancoTorrent is an implementeation for the Bittorent Protocol written in C++.

This bittorent client if full working with mininova .torrent file. 
I implemented this protocol without using any additiononal helper libraries like boost and etc., I didn't use them only for learning purposes.

Feel free to use my code for anything you want :)
Good luck!
